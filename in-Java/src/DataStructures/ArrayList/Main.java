    *  random access - very fast O(1)
    *
    * it is equivalent to Vectors but arrayList is not synchronized
    *
    * all operations run in o(N) time approximately
    *
    * remove an item from arrayList  is not efficient it takes o(N)
    *       time as we have to shift all elements
    *
    * if our program is just about adding and getting elements with known
    *       indexes arrayList are perfect
    *
    * to reduce the incremental reallocation we can set the CAPACITY of an
    *       arraylist when we define it
    *               - new ArrayList<>(10);
